\paragraph{}The aim of this laboratory assignment is to study the behaviour of a circuit containing linear components, in this case, resistors. Moreover, it also presents Voltage and Current Sources, either Independent or Dependent. In Figure~\ref{fig:circuitol1} the stated circuit is presented.
Despite being a simple circuit, it is perfect to experiment some important Circuit Theory's analysing tools, presented in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, so that sotware simulation and theoretical analysis can be stacked up against each other more easily.

\paragraph{}In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, either by the Node Analysis %(~\ref{subsec:node_analysis}) 
and Mesh Analysis %(~\ref{subsec:mesh_analysis}) 
methods, giving us some insights on different, although equivalent forms of exploring a linear circuit. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by computacional simulation tools, via \textit{ngspice}, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
