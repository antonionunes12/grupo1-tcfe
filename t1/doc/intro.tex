% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study the behaviour of a circuit containing linear components, in this case, resistors. Besides, it presents Voltage and Current Sources, either Independent or Dependent. The circuit can be seen if Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.\\
This circuit will allow us to experiment some important Circuit Theory' tools.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
